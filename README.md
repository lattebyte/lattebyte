### **[LinkedIn: former Fugro Tech Lead JZ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-z-583589102/)**

JZ and the team were the first within Fugro globally to design and physically implement an AI-driven robotics control system, successfully passing field tests in high-latency and complex environments in late 2023. After departing Fugro in August 2024, JZ is now committed to contributing to the broader community.
